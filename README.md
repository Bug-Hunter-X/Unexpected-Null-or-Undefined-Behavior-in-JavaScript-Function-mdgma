This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug involving unexpected null or undefined values. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected version with explicit null checks. This is a frequent source of errors, especially when working with data from external sources or APIs where null values are possible. The solution highlights the importance of defensive programming when dealing with potential null or undefined values.
